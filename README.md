# CATC

## Note: This script is now superflous since Groundspeak implemented this feature 

Correct All The Coordinates (CATC) is a Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey script that enables the functionality to change the coordinates of every cachetype on geocaching.com

A tutorial on how to install the script can be found here (German): http://blog.dennistreysa.de/?p=345
